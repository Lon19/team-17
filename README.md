##Building an Executable
 -- In *Unity* You need to go to file then go to build settings, choose a platform, press build. Choose the directory that you wish to save it in and it will develop an executable for you. If you want to produce for an android device, then you have to have an android SDK and NDK installed and configured. Same goes for the IOS, you will need the relevent IOS SDKs to develop for them.
